        <p>Below is a ranking of five different State websites.</p>

        <li>
            <header><a href="http://www.alabama.gov" target="_blank">Alabama</a> </header>

            <p>I chose Alabama as my favorite website for several reasons. It is a very clean website with a lot of white space and red accent colors, similar to what you would expect of a simpler southern state. With regards to the pandemic, it has primarily become the duty of the state to devlop a response catered for their citizens. This means that easy access to COVID information and the Governors office is extremely important. The Alabama website features quick links to Governor Ivy's office and the COVID information hub. The site looked great on mobile and as an added bonus, the search bar. Unlike many of the other states I looked at, when you use the search bar on the Alabama website it only shows the top 5 results as a dropdown menu and stays on the home page. This makes looking for things much less confusing as you aren't taken to a search page of jumbles articles, laws, etc. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <header><a href="http://www.mn.gov" target="_blank">Minnesota</a> </header>
            <p>Minnesota comes in a very close second on my list of websites. They have a nice clean site with lots of blue space instead of white space. They feature tabs that easily allow you to visit the governors office or reach any state agencies. Another neat feature offered by the minnesota website is connection to cities. If you click on the cities tab it will help residents locate even more local information they might be looking for. Minnesota lost point on my rankings because the search bar was not as user friendly as Alabama's and if you go to the "Connect with the government" section you cannot click on the photos, ony the words.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <header><a href="http://www.mass.gov" target="_blank">Massachusetts</a> </header>
            <p>Massachusetts and Minnesota ranked very closely for their spots. Both websites had strong lead attributes. They looked nice and worked well on mobile. Mass.gov however, did not have anything other than COVID information on their page. Upon entering the website it is all links to repoening Massachusetts, guides to teleworking, and updated COVID numbers. Even in the search bar those are the reccomneded searches. People will be coming to the state website for reasons other than teleworking. There needs to be clearer paths to parks and rec, tax forms, places in Massacheusetts, etc.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <header><a href="http://www.nh.gov" target="_blank">New Hampshire</a> </header>
            <p>While New Hampshire had a much more informational website than Masssacheusetts, the layout was defnintely where they lost points. While they offered many different options for actions to take on the site, they were quite depressing. On their featured tabs they had child abuse offices, opioid addiction, sex offender registry, and criminal record forms. While all of these tabs might be necessary, it is not something that I would want plastered all over my state's website. This website also does not work well with mobile.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <header><a href="http://www.alaska.gov" target="_blank">Alaska</a> </header>
            <p>Alaska had the worst website in my opinion. It looked like something that had come from the late 2000's and has never been updated. While they had all the necessary links, governor's office, COVID, etc. There was so much more that could have been done to make the site more user friendly. My biggest concern is that the site does not work on mobile at all. When on your computer you need to hover over the pictures of the mountains to see links, it is nearly impossible to hover on a phone. They need to adapt to allow for a fresh user interface.
