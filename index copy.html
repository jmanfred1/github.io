    <h1>3 Website Comparison</h1>
    <p>For my two great websites I chose the Apple website and the Patagonia websites. For my bad website I chose the Helena bighorns website. I chose the Apple and Patagonia websites because I check them frequently and am continuously impressed with their integration of new features and user experience. I chose the Helena bighorns webitste because, well I designed it. They use a web builder for hockey teams that is not easy to use in terms of web design, but great for other things like scheduling. </p>

    <p>The <a href="http://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a> website is one of the cleanest websites on the internet. When comparing products they use 2 column tables using the div “row” feature. The homepage features products laid out on a large white or black background, allowing the design features of the product to be put onto full display for the user. They also use little text on their website, it is much more about showing the features rather than explaining them. Even in the features comparison tool, they use small images rather than text to show the features. The scrolling on the website brings different videos and animations that roll through features as well.
        <p />

        <p><a href="http://www.patagonia.com" target="_blank">Patagonia</a> has a very open and airy website. Pictures of the outdoors fill the screen. They use similar effects to apple in their website. As you go along a photo that was in a frame will expand to fill the entire screen, letting you know you are on a new topic on the site. Unlike the Apple website, Patagonia features a dropdown submenu that is full of different clothing style options. Their text below products features small boxes with 100% text size and transparent background. This allows them to incorporate different animations when the mouse moves over products that aren’t impacted by the size of the screen. The overall color palate is large white and black text bubbles that compliment the large scale photos of open spaces and mountains. </p>

        <p>The <a href="http://www.helenabighorns.com" target="_blank">Bighorns</a> website was built from a hard to use web design platform. I tired to match our colors and design header and background photos. These unfortunately don’t appear well unless you are on a wide screen. Even a laptop screen is too narrow to display the background image properly. Unlike the other two websites which formatted most properties with class attributes, the bighorns website used id attributes. I feel like it wasn’t entirely necessary to make that many unique id’s for elements that didn’t need to be unique. Overall if I could do it again, I would try to make the site less busy, more open arena photos and less logos and news articles, as they overwhelm the page. </p>
